      History
     </h2>
     <p>
      The proposal to form the International Union of Nutritional Sciences wasfirst discussed in July 1946 in London, where a meeting had been convened by theBritish Nutrition Society. This meeting was attended by 22 research workers from13 countries. Two years later, a meeting of an International ProvisionalCommittee was held with sessions in London on 10 and 11 June 1948. Statutes andbylaws were discussed, and the principal objects of the Union were defined as:a) the exchange of information, b) the organization of international congresses,c) the publication of the results of scientific investigation. A small ExecutiveCommittee was appointed, and Professor E.J. Bigwood (Belgium) was electedChairperson, and Dr. Leslie J. Harris (UK) Secretary General.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since then the Union has grown steadily. At first the holding of thecongresses was its main task, but, in the course of the years, other equallyimportant activities have developed which need long-term planning and efficientadministration.
     </p>
     <p>
      The work of the Union is directed by the General Assembly, which meets at thetime of the international congresses. The General Assembly, consisting ofdelegates appointed by the Adhering Bodies, is the highest authority of theUnion, and the Council serves as an executive group between the meetings of theAssembly. The number of the delegates from the Adhering Body depends on themembership category which the Body has chosen. Members adhere to the Unionthrough National Academies or other appropriate scientific groups. At presentthe Union has 79 full members plus 1 in observer status, and 15 affiliatedbodies.

      According to the IUNS Statutes and Rules of Procedure, Commissions andCommittees are established to accomplish more extensive internationalcooperation among scientists in nutrition-related research and education. Thework of the Committees is expected frequently to result in reports that arepublished, subsequent to their approval by the President. Several importantmeetings of individual Committees have been held and large conferences of theCommissions and Committees have been arranged. In the selection of the personnelfor the Committees, due consideration is given to balanced geographicalrepresentation from different areas. The Commissions and Committees work inclose collaboration with each other under the supervision of the President andthe three Vice-Presidents. For financial reasons much of the work is done bycorrespondence.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the 1968 meeting of the General Assembly of the International Council ofScientific Unions (ICSU), the IUNS was elected to membership. The admission toICSU was an important step in the history of IUNS: the Union's status as anindependent scientific body was thus recognized; its financial situation wasimproved by ICSU grants; and appropriate collaboration with other scientificorganizations and participation in current international projects werestrengthened. The International Unions of Biological Sciences, PhysiologicalSciences, Biochemistry, Pure and Applied Biophysics, Pharmacology, Immunologicaland Micro-biological Societies, with the IUNS, form the so-called&quot;Bio-Unions&quot; of ICSU.
     </p>
     <p>
      The IUNS has a special consultative status with the Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF), the Administrative Committee onCoordination/Subcommittee on Nutrition and is an associate member of the Councilfor International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), and has signed aMemorandum of Understanding with the United Nations University (UNU). Closecooperation exists with the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO), and various ICSU bodies, and with the International Unionof Food Science and Technology (IUFoST), including establishing joint committeesand working groups.
     </p>
     <p>
      The IUNS Secretariat for the period of 1997-2005 is housed inthe School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles.
