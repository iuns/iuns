       At the Osaka, Japan Council Meeting (March2002), the Council suggested an improved process of choice of members ofnominating committees.&nbsp; To ensure an equitable level of engagement of theAdhering Bodies, the IUNS Council recommended improvements in the process bywhich nominations are developed by the Nominating Committee and by the GeneralAssembly, as follows:
      </span>
     </h3>
     <p>
      <span>
       &nbsp;1) &nbsp; Adhering Bodies should receive additionalencouragement to provide nominees to the General Secretary.&nbsp; This would ensure awider slate of candidates, maximizing the opportunity for regionalrepresentation.&nbsp; Council will actively pursue nominations from all AdheringBodies starting 12 months prior to the General Assembly, with nominations due 6months prior to the General Assembly.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       &nbsp;2)&nbsp;&nbsp; To enhance the process of informed choice,the Council now requires that each nomination is accompanied by a writtenCandidates Statement of less that 500 words, sent electronically to the GeneralSecretary, that supplies information about each candidate's relevant backgroundand institutional affiliation, qualifications and potential contributions to theIUNS.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       &nbsp;3)&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nominating Committee will meet anddecide on their slate of nominees, and post their names and biographicalstatements by the evening 2 days prior to the 1st General Assembly meeting.&nbsp;
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Mindful of the rule that candidatesnominated from the floor of the General Assembly must be acceptable to theirAdhering Body, such candidates must also supply a written Candidate's Statementof less that 500 words, and written evidence that there is no objection by theirAdhering Body.&nbsp; These statements must be supplied to the General Secretary intime to be posted on the evening of the day prior to the 1st General Assemblymeeting.&nbsp; This will permit the preparation of a consolidated list of nomineesfrom the Nominating Committee and the floor.&nbsp; Nominees from the floor will beformally presented, by name and affiliation only, at the 2nd General Assemblymeeting, without discussion.&nbsp;
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       5)&nbsp;&nbsp; The vote will then proceed according toIUNS Rules of Procedure.
