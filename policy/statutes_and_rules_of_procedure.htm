guidelines have been formulated: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IUNS 

should be involved early in the planning of the programme of meetings preferably

Reputable scientists should be invited to participate in the scientific 

programme and the presentation of the nutrition science should be balanced. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 

principle, the programme should appeal to scientists from throughout one region

from a wide geographical area. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 

level of IUNS cooperation may differ for different meetings: for example IUNS 

may have liaison status or the status of a sponsor or supporter. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Request for IUNS involvement should reach the Secretary General of IUNS at least 

six months before the meeting. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h4><!--mstheme--><font color="#333399">D. <u>IUNS Guidelines for Selection of a Congress Venue</u> <!--mstheme--></font></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal">The General Assembly is responsible for selection of the 

location of congresses. To assist them in this procedure, adhering bodies that 

wish to be considered should forward a formal letter of invitation to the IUNS 

Secretariat together with supporting documents at least nine months in advance 

of the next meeting of the General Assembly. <u>Supporting documents should 

include the following</u>: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Assurance of adherence to the rules of ICSU regarding free entry to all 

delegates irrespective of country of origin; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Evidence of adequate facilities to accommodate the housing, administrative, and 

program needs of the congress; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Documentation of support by government and national scientific organizations of 

the country offering the invitation; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Evidence of adequate financial guarantees to cover the pre-congress 

preparatory expenses and any subsequent shortfalls should such occur. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Evidence of awareness of and willingness to follow Rules of Procedure II, 

paragraphs<i> </i>10-14. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The IUNS Secretariat, upon receipt of the above information 

will distribute the relevant documentation to Officers in advance of the General 

Assembly meeting. The Officers will examine the documentation and bring to the 

attention of the Secretariat significant issues that could cause a specific site 

to be inappropriate. The Secretariat will inform Council members and alert the 

appropriate adhering body of these concerns in advance of the General Assembly 

meeting. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the General Assembly meeting, the procedure for site 

selection will be held in <u>two parts</u> separated by a period for informal 

discussion. In the first part a representative from each adhering body who has 

submitted a formal invitation will make a brief presentation. When all 

presentations have been completed, the President will make known any outstanding 

issues identified by Council that could influence the decision. The respective 

representative will be given opportunity to respond to the concern and the floor 

will then be open for discussion by delegates. Discussions will be closed by 

motion of the delegates. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">During the period for informal discussion prior to taking 

the vote, the countries offering invitations will be provided a list of eligible 

adhering bodies present. They will be provided a formally designated and 

controlled space in which to mount displays, distribute materials or inform the 

delegates and attendees of attributes favorable for selection of that location 

as the site of a future congress. All promotional activities should be 

restricted to the designated controlled site. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Voting on the applicants will occur in the second part. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A teller committee consisting of three members will be 

elected by the delegates. A written ballot will be taken; each adhering body in 

good standing will have one vote. Ballots will be counted by the tellers. The 

invitation receiving the majority vote will be presented to the delegates. The 

following rules will determine a majority vote: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all 

eligible voting members are present and have cast their vote or abstained, a 

simple majority will be decisive. A simple majority vote is a vote when the 

inviting adhering body gets more than fifty percent of the votes. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .5in">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all 

eligible voting members are not present, for the purpose of this vote a majority 

vote is to be taken as a number of positive votes that represent more than 50% 

of the eligible votes as determined by the number of eligible adhering bodies, 

each of which has one vote. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If no simple majority is reached the voting will continue 

by preferential ballot by the eligible adhering bodies present. Where there are 

more than two invitations of IUNS adhering bodies then two preferential ballots 

should be held. The first preferential ballot will discriminate between the two 

invitations which are preferred most and the other ones. The second preferential 

ballot should take the decision which of the two remaining adhering bodies will 

become responsible for the location of the IUNS congress concerned. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the event that a tie vote occurs, up to three revotes 

will be taken. If the issue remains unresolved, the chairperson of the Assembly 

will decide the issue by toss of coin. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, IUNS welcomes external funding from all possible sources, provided 

that the funding arrangements are supportive of the objectives of the Union.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be full declaration at all times of funding sources and their use.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funding source should not regard the funding exercise as an opportunity to&nbsp;use the name or reputation of the IUNS for promotional or commercial 

purposes.&nbsp; IUNS must maintain full control over whether or not the results of a 

meeting or projects are published using the IUNS Logo and the contents of such 

publications must be reviewed by IUNS prior to publications.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible ethical issues should be guided by reference to internationally accepted codes of practice, such as 

those of the WHO.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funds may be accepted for support of various aspects of a particular meeting or 

project, but IUNS has responsibility over how the funds are utilized.&nbsp; For 

example, industry support should be acceptable only if it is non-designated with 

respect to the scientific program, i.e. there would be no association, in the 

conference materials, between a given contribution and any specific symposium or 

any individual speaker or chairperson.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: 1.0in">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where sufficient doubt exists about the acceptance or use of external funding, 

the matter should be raised with IUNS Council.&nbsp; When IUNS Council is unable to 

resolve the issue, it may be further referred to an Ethics Committee appointed 

by the Union as needed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in">These guidelines will be 

routinely available to all adhering bodies and potential  funders.</p>
