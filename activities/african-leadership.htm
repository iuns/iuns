<h1>Summary and Main Conclusions</h1>



<p>The Cape Town consultation is part of a global initiative spearheaded by the

United Nations University /Food and Nutrition Programme (UNU/FNP) and the

International Union of Nutritional Sciences (IUNS), in collaboration with other

partners, for enhancing human leadership and organizational capacity to address

global nutrition challenges. This initiative is motivated by the growing

recognition of the important role of nutrition in human development. The first

workshop in this context was held in Manila, the Philippines (see Summary

Report); consultations for other regions are planned. For Africa, another two

consultations are programmed for the West and East Africa regions.</p>



<p>The UNU/IUNS initiative is based on the recognition that significant work on

capacity building is ongoing in many regions, and therefore seeks to build on

these efforts, and, where deemed necessary by stakeholders, to help to

strengthen them. The Cape Town consultation underlined that in Southern Africa

indeed much has been done and that a lot is ongoing, both at national and at

regional levels. A good number of programmes and activities are being

implemented and many persons have been trained in the field of nutrition.

However, although significant improvements have been made, data on health and

nutritional problems show a negative trend. It is evident that a number of

technical, socioeconomic and demographic factors affect this deteriorating

situation. The primary goal of all programmes should be the improvement of the

nutritional situation of the people in communities. Adequate investment in human

leadership and institutional capacity is seen as an essential mechanism to reach

nutrition goals.</p>



<p>In this regard the following issues came up:</p>

   inadequate; institutions working in this field should use appropriate ways to

   communicate and better tailor activities to identified needs. Also, there is

   inadequate coordination between different sectors/organizations working on

   nutrition.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

   of nutrition must be motivated and skilled to make people at policy levels

   realize that poverty does not only cause malnutrition, but the other way

   around, i.e., malnutrition causes poverty. Thus advocacy skills/techniques

   should become part of training of people working in the area of nutrition at

   all levels.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">



<p>There was general agreement that prior action would be needed to improve the

situation and in particular to improve leadership and institutional capacity.

Action would mainly have to cover the development of new leadership skilled in

management, policy analysis and advocacy; client-need driven methods,

multidisciplinary training approaches, and better use of existing resources. The

meeting discussed several possible models to achieve the wanted action, based on

the recognition that there is considerable experience and potency available in

the Southern Africa region. The idea of an 'Action Learning Cooperative' that is

based on the principles of collaborative partnership, learning together in a

noncompetitive way, was positively appreciated by the meeting. However, details

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#008000">Part 1: Background, Aims and Scope of the Consultation<!--mstheme--></font></h2>



<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Background<!--mstheme--></font></h3>



<p>The consultation was part of a global initiative spearheaded by the United

Nations University (UNU) and the International Union of Nutritional Sciences (IUNS),

in collaboration with other partners. This global initiative is motivated by the

growing recognition of the important role of nutrition in human development.</p>



<p>The first workshop-convened jointly by UNU and IUNS- was held in Manila, the

Philippines in August 1996. The Southern Africa consultation held in Cape Town

-specifically focussing on Southern Africa- was the first of three planned

consultations for Africa. Two others will be held in West Africa, and in Eastern

and Central Africa. Consultations elsewhere are planned for South and Central

America, Asia, the Middle East, and the newly independent republics of the

former Soviet Union.</p>



<p>This initiative is motivated by the growing recognition of the important role

of nutrition in human development. Nutritional problems in the world are rapidly

evolving as global socio-economic conditions change, and the interconnected

nature of national economies, demographic transitions, and continued population

growth pose new challenges to the food system. In the face of these

developments, investment in human and institutional capacity to address

nutrition -an investment, which has been inadequate and uneven in many regions-

must receive priority attention. To be successful, a bold initiative to enhance

human and organizational capacity to address malnutrition must be driven by

leaders in a particular region. This UNU/IUNS initiative recognizes that

significant work on capacity building is ongoing in many regions, and therefore

seeks to build on these efforts, and, where deemed necessary by stakeholders, to

help to strengthen these efforts.</p>



<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Aim<!--mstheme--></font></h3>



<p>The aim of the three-day consultation was to share ideas and build consensus

on the need for a concerted effort to strengthen human and institutional

capacity to combat malnutrition in Southern Africa and to formulate a bold

action plan to make it happen.</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#996600">Programme of the consultation&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h3>



<p>The consultation was approached as an action-learning activity. After the

start with a wide-ranging exchange of ideas, the discussions became more and

more action-oriented and resulted at the end in a concrete proposal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the discussions, plenary and in small groups, participants brought in

their ideas and shared their experiences and insights.</p>



<p>The first day focused on developing a shared understanding of the problems

and challenges encountered in efforts to institutionalize the response to

malnutrition in the region, with particular emphasis on issues related to

high-level training and capacity building. Brief presentations were given on</p>

<p>The second day focused on generating organizational and managerial solutions

to the issues raised before. Resource persons from within the group of

participants had been invited to present their experiences on 'best practices'

in capacity building and institutional strengthening for nutrition programme

effectiveness. Additionally, some other participants presented 'key ideas' based

on their work experience.</p>



<p>The third day focused on the action to be taken. Based on the identified

problems and 'good practices' in the days before, the meeting focussed on

possible solutions, as well as on the mechanism for the needed implementation of

the proposed actions.</p>

<p>The overall aim of the global initiative that comprises a series of

workshops/meetings in diverse regions, is to asses what type of nutrition

training is needed throughout the world in order to develop human and

institutional capacity to address malnutrition. Past meetings showed that most

countries have a fairly good basis, but mainly focussing on the biomedical

dimensions. Now it is time to give attention to the integration of social and

programmatic aspects in training.</p>



<p>As for Africa, and in particular Southern Africa, it is obvious that a lot is

going on in the field of nutrition in the different countries, and certainly

also at regional levels. But also, Africa is still facing a lot of problems. The

idea behind this consultation is to help accelerate the development of human and

organizational capacity. The consultation is to be seen as a brainstorming

opportunity: to discuss on the basis of an assessment of experiences and

constraints how to move forward. The outcome should be a strategic vision and a

plan with clear priorities, with indicators where to go and mechanisms how to

reach the goals.</p>



<p>Participants of this consultation take part on a personal base. They were

invited because of their experiences with and/or involvement in human capacity.

Most of them have a leadership role in Africa. They are expected to liaise with

the outside world and to bring the agenda-as developed during this consultation-

to the implementation phase.</p>

<p>The above exemplify efforts for a systematic approach against malnutrition

and the region has documented success stories on reduction of malnutrition

especially covering the period of the 1980's, e.g. Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya and

other successful small scale projects. The challenge has been in going to scale,

or allowing the positive experiences to mushroom, and to have sustained

reduction of malnutrition. While we all want to see that half-full glass

signifying the success and achievements, we are aware of the recent

deterioration as we watch the water pouring out and that glass getting emptied.

Malnutrition levels are rising in several countries and so are the numbers of

malnourished children. The fact that rates of malnutrition remain high in many

countries is a reflection of violation of the right to nutrition.</p>



<p>Sub-Saharan Africa has taken pride in having an underweight prevalence that

is half that of South Asia. Nevertheless, still about one in three children

under the age of five is underweight. In three countries the prevalence of

underweight is over 40%, approximating the levels in South Asia. There are also

large disparities within countries. For example Zimbabwe with an underweight

prevalence of 16%, below the average for sub-Saharan Africa, have 3 provinces

with prevalence of over 20%. South Africa average prevalence of 9% hides the

high prevalence in the Northern Province, for example.</p>



<p>Governments in the region can take pride in the success achieved in the area

of universal salt iodization, a strategy pursued especially in the mid 1990's

for reduction of iodine deficiency disorders. As shown on the map, in about one

third of the countries in Eastern and Southern Africa over 80% of the households

have access to iodized salt. Further efforts are required to improve the quality

of iodized salt, address problems of small producers and ensure access to

iodized salt in countries in conflict (e.g. Ethiopia used to receive 80% of its

domestic iodized salt requirement from Eritrea). The success in increasing

access to iodized salt can be attributed to a clear strategy, mobilization of

resources, partnership between government and the private sector, among other

factors.</p>



<p>Another area in which the region has had relative success is that of control

of Vitamin A deficiency. The map shows clearly that Vitamin A deficiency is

still a problem in most countries of the region. Most countries have included

vitamin A supplementation m their country strategies and recognize the

importance of multiple, strategies to prevent vitamin A deficiency. Until

recently, coverage rates for supplementation were quite low and only a few

countries e.g. Zambia and Malawi, had achieved reasonable coverage with routine

EPI contacts. At the start of the National Immunization Days (NIDS) for polio

campaign, the regional coverage of vitamin A supplementation was only 24%. About

25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have included vitamin A supplementation in

NIDs and the coverage has doubled. It is estimated that 60% of young children

received at least one high-dose vitamin A capsule in 1998. But adequate

supplementation means two doses over a twelve-month period, so further effort is

required. Countries are also pursuing dietary promotion and health intervention

but the effectiveness of these approaches has not been adequately assessed.

Fortification is also being pursued with Zambia leading the way with sugar

fortification.</p>



<p>There has been less success in the prevention and control of anemia. Up to

50% of women are anemic during pregnancy and anemia is affecting up to 60% of

preschool children in some countries. In most countries though, programmes focus

on anemia of pregnancy and the problem in pre-school children and the

implications on the development of the child goes unrecognized. The most common

intervention is iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy. This

intervention is inadequate because women present to health facilities too late

in pregnancy and health workers are not reaching out into communities. Some

attention is starting to be given to the problem of anemia recognizing its

multiple causes. Several countries are now conducting assessments and hopefully

more comprehensive programmes will be implemented.</p>



<p>Protein energy malnutrition remains a major threat to development in the

region. The maps show clearly that most countries have a Low Birth Weight rate

of over 10%, signifying a serious maternal health and nutrition problem. As

pointed out above, about one in three children under the age of five years is

underweight in sub-Saharan Africa. If we look at countries of Eastern and

Southern Africa, about half of the countries report stunting prevalence of over

40%. The average underweight prevalence had stagnated at around 35% between 1990

and 1997, and several countries are now reporting deterioration. Preliminary

results of the analysis for the 4th World Nutrition Situation Report (ACC/SCN)

show that Sub-Saharan Africa will have underweight prevalence of around 35% in

year 2000, a rate similar to that observed in 1975. The harsh reality is that

for this indicator the region will be where it was 25 years ago.</p>



<p>The deterioration of the nutrition situation measured by underweight

prevalence is accompanied by deterioration in other indicators like infant

mortality rate and under 5 mortality rate. For example, the recent Demographic

and Health Survey results for Kenya show that IMR has increased by about 40%

between the late 1980's and the mid 1990's, and is continuing to worsen.</p>



<p>Among the factors contributing to declines in nutrition status and increase

in IMR and U5MR is the HIV/AIDS pandemic that has hit the region hard.

Discussion on the nutrition situation in the region would therefore not be

complete without reflecting on this. Countries affected by armed conflict and

HIV/AIDS have worsening situations in general. For example in Zambia, over 90%

of severely malnourished children in Lusaka are HIV-positive. The statistics for

HIV/AIDS in the region are grim indeed.</p>



<p>By the end of 1998, Sub-Saharan Africa comprised 22.5 million or two-thirds

of the world's total population living with HIV/AIDS, including one million

children. The graph showing total cases of HIV/AIDS clearly shows where the

burden is, e.g. 34 million people in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected since

the start of the pandemic compared to a world total of 47.3 million There have

been 11.5 deaths in Africa, out of 13.9 deaths world wide. A quarter of these

deaths are children. Eastern and Southern Africa is the worst hit region with an

estimated 70% of sub-Saharan Africa's or 50% of the world's total people living

with HIV/AIDS. Adult infection rates have reached 25% of the sexually active

population. In South Africa, for example, the infection rates reported from

antenatal clinics are 26.9% in KwaZulu Natal and 22.6% in Mpumalanga compares to

a national average of 17%. By the end of 1998, over 6 million children under the

age of 15 years lost their mother to AIDS in Eastern and Southern Africa, 70% of

the world's orphans.</p>



<p>The implications of HIV/AIDS for nutrition are far reaching. Households are

being left without primary care givers and young children are left without

option but to care for the siblings without the capacities to do so. Household

food security is affected, as is the ability to access services. Household and

community resources that could potentially be used for improving nutrition have

to be used for care of the sick and funerals--5,500 of them a day! The nutrition

community is being faced with different challenges in areas of infant feeding.

Guidelines for infant feeding in cases of HIV/AIDS have been prepared and

countries are struggling to put these into practice against a background of most

mothers not having an opportunity to know their HIV status.</p>



<p>Other factors to be considered as attributing to the trend in nutrition

status are emergencies, drought, floods and wars, increasing poverty, and

reductions in social sector spending. As emergencies are becoming a permanent

feature in the region, programmes have to factor these into their planning such

that adequate response is provided. It is important to recognize malnutrition as

a cause of poverty.</p>



<p>As the focus of this meeting is about capacity building, there is a need to

ask the question &quot;whose capacity?&quot; Our development paradigm recognizes

people as key actors in addressing their problems including the nutrition

problem. It is also recognized that households and communities play a key role

in caring for their children. It is therefore important that systematic efforts

are made to strengthen the capacity of households and communities to address

nutrition problems. Such capacity will make the assessment, analysis, action and

the learning process for better assessment, analysis and action more efficient.

Those who will facilitate such a process themselves need to be better equipped

to do this. The needs at the household and community level have to inform the

process of capacity building at other levels.</p>

<h4><!--mstheme--><font color="#333399">Introduction&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h4>



<p>There has been international concern about the lack of significant progress

in improving the food and nutrition in the developing world. Available data

indicate that one in every three children under six years in sub-Saharan Africa

is underweight. It is the only region in the world in which poor nutritional

status and poverty are stagnant or worsening. A few countries such as Zimbabwe

and Tanzania have achieved substantial progress in nutrition improvement under

difficult conditions:</p>



<p>This review is not meant to be exhaustive, but to merely highlight some

experiences of institutional capacity building in parts of Africa.</p>



<h4><!--mstheme--><font color="#333399">Historical experience in institutional capacity-building&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h4>



<p>For the past decades several national, regional and international initiatives

have drawn attention to the need for institutional capacity building in the area

of food and nutrition, with a specific focus of developing countries. Since the

establishment of the UNU in 1975, it has given highest priority to capacity

building, especially south of the Sahara.</p>



<p>A joint UNU and ACC/SCN working group convened in 1984 to address the

strengthening of institutions concerned with food and nutrition. The working

group recommended high priority is awarded to the development of capacity of

institutions that have potential to become centers of excellence. The issue was

further discussed at the IUNS meeting held in Seoul, South Korea during 1989 and

the very subject on institutional capacity building was a title of a workshop

held by the UNU and IUNS in 1996.</p>



<p>By 1997, it was reported that over 600 researchers and young scientists, over

40% of the UNU fellowship awarded, had received post-graduate training in the

area of food and nutrition.</p>



<p>The results of institutional building in Africa are a cause of great concern

as generally the initiatives have not been successful. Despite the reported fact

that almost 27% of the UNU nutrition fellowships were awarded to people from

Africa, only 1,5% of the fellowships were implemented at UNU associated

institutions in Africa. In 1988, a joint UNU and AAU (African Association of

Universities) was initiated aimed at strengthening national capacity in food and

nutrition involving seven African countries. The initiative was terminated in

1994, because an evaluation done indicated limited impact on strengthening

capacity for research and advanced training.</p>



<p>The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) has been involved in the

strengthening of a number of food and nutrition institutions in Africa, for

example, the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Institute, Zambian National Food and

Nutrition Commission, the Tanzanian Food and Nutrition Centre, and the National

Nutrition Unit - Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. The outcome of

the Zimbabwe and Tanzanian's experience has generally been considered positive

in some aspects of the capacity building process.</p>



<p>The Applied Nutrition Programme (ANP) of the University of Nairobi was

launched in 1985 with support of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische

Zuzammarbeit (GTZ), the German agency of technical cooperation. Nearly 100

individuals from Kenya and other countries in Eastern, Central and Southern

Africa have gone through the MSc Applied Nutrition programmes trained by

high-level expert faculty. The ANP serves as a good example on how to support

build- up institutional capacity.</p>



<p>The East, Central and Southern Africa Food and Nutrition (ECSAFAN)

Cooperation, established in 1979 by the CRHCS/ECSA Health Ministers conference

is the oldest networking institution aimed at addressing food and nutrition

problems in the ECSA region. It was only in the mid 1990's that the CRHCS/ECSA

intensified the effort of institutional capacity building in collaboration with

other institutions within the region (University of Zimbabwe, Pan-African

Institute for Development East and Southern Africa (Zambia) and international

universities (Wageningen Agricultural University- the Netherlands, Emory - USA

and Southampton - UK).</p>



<p>In the context of the European Union Programme NATURA-NECTAR, that was

carried out by three European universities and coordinated by the Wageningen

Agricultural University, five 2-4 week modules on different nutrition subjects

have been developed in partnership with universities from Benin, Ghana, Kenya,

South-Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research

Institute.</p>



<p>While generally the efforts of institutional capacity building in Africa have

not been successful, the initiatives in Latin America and Asia have been

relatively successful. In these regions a number of key regional and national

institutions have been established, for example the Institute of Nutrition of

Central America and Panama in Guatemala, the Institute of Nutrition and Food

Technology in Chile, and the Institute of Nutrition at Mahidol University in

Thailand, to name a few.</p>



<p>A number of lessons can be distilled from the experience of

institutional-building or strengthening. The fundamental, lesson learned has

been that political will must exist. Govemment support is indispensable for any

capacity-building to be successful. The other key lessons learned include: a)

development of a multiple skilled core group of well-trained and highly

motivated professionals; b) a critical mass of well-trained people, with a good,

strong and visionary leader and long-term budgeting commitment from both the

member countries and external financial assistance.</p>



<p>As much as successful institution-capacity building initiatives are of

different forms, it seems that in Africa initiatives implemented at academic

institutins are more likely to be successful than at government institutions.</p>



<h4><!--mstheme--><font color="#333399">Some guiding principles in institution building&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h4>



<p>Any approach to institutional building should be based on a thorough

situation analysis, with a clear goal of promoting institutional structures and

capacity. The situation analysis would gather information on institutional

capacities and identify areas that require strengthening, determine the level of

knowledge and skills of their staff, financial support and physical assets.</p>



<p>The effectiveness of food -and nutrition institutions requires good

management, financial sustainability and the process of phasing-out support

should be planned for -at the beginning of the process.</p>



<h4><!--mstheme--><font color="#333399">Challenges&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h4>



<p>The unacceptable situation of lack of institution capacity is a challenge for

food and nutrition specialists and related practitioners both at national and

regional level. From the key challenges, strategies about ways of taking the

African nutrition challenges into the new millenium can be identified:</p>
